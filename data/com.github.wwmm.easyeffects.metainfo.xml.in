  <description>
    <p>EasyEffects is an advanced audio manipulation tool. It includes an equalizer, limiter, compressor and a reverberation tool, just to mention a few. To complement this there is also a built in spectrum analyzer.</p>
    <p>EasyEffects is the successor to PulseEffects. EasyEffects only supports PipeWire's audio server. PulseAudio users should instead use PulseEffects.</p>
    <p>Because EasyEffects uses the default PipeWire sound server it will work with most, if not all, applications you use. All supported applications are presented in the main window, where each can be enabled individually.</p>
    <p>Besides manipulating sound output, EasyEffects is able to apply effects to an input device, such as a microphone. This is, for example, useful in audio recording, but it also works well during voice conversations.</p>
    <p>When EasyEffects is launched it will conveniently remember the configuration used in the last session. It is also possible to save all the current settings as profiles.</p>

    <release type="stable" version="6.1.2" date="2021-09-20T00:00:00Z">

        <ul>
          <li>Improved compatibility with WirePlumber. This is needed to run on systems that decided to use it instead of the</li>

    <release type="stable" version="6.1.1" date="2021-09-17T00:00:00Z">
      <description>
        <p>This release adds the following features:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>When trying to add an autoloading profile for a device already in the list its target preset will be updated. This way we can change the profile preset without having to remove and recreating it.</li>
          <li>The preset autoloading support implementation was redesigned again. It should work on more hardware now. For more information see issue [1051](https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects/issues/1051).</li>
          <li>If the Limiter or the Maximizer are set in the last position of the plugin stack, new plugins are added at the second to last position in order to prevent hardware damage on eventually high output level.</li>
          <li>Removing an application from the blocklist, its previous enabled state is restored.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This release fixes the following bugs:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sometimes when removing imported models from the noise reduction plugin the current used model was not properly updated. This should be fixed now.</li>
          <li>When editing presets files in an external editor, duplicated entries won't be shown in our presets menu.</li>
          <li>Now the blocklist is correctly set when switching presets.</li>
          <li>Now the status of the global bypass button is correctly updated when changing plugin stack.</li>
          <li>Missing icons on the system should not be shown inside the application info UI</li>
          <li>Some icons not showing in Plasma DE with Breeze icon theme should appear now.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>The Loudness plugin is being used again for the reasons described at https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects/issues/820. This means that http://drobilla.net/plugins/mda/Loudness is an optional dependency again.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This release fixes the following bug:</p>
        <ul>

    <release type="stable" version="6.0.1" date="2021-07-09T00:00:00Z">
      <description>
        <p>This release adds the following features:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Improved equalizer interface.</li>
          <li>Now we use a sidechain LSP compressor that allows the user to select and external source as the sidechain input.</li>
          <li>We now support the LSP compressor `Boosting` mode.</li>
          <li>When `split-channels` is enabled in the equalizer the imported APO preset will be applied only to the channel being visualized in the window. This will allow to import different presets for each channel instead of just settings the same values to both.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This release fixes the following bug:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed some segmentation faults that could happen when creating a preset autoloading profile or removing presets</li>

    <release type="stable" version="6.0.0" date="2021-07-07T00:00:00Z">
      <description>
        <p>This release adds the following features:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>This is one of the biggest releases that I have ever made. The amount of changes is so big that it is hard to talk about everything here.</li>
          <li>The following are just the most import ones. People interested on the journey that got us here can take</li>
          <li>a look at https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects/issues/904 and https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects/issues/874.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This release adds the following features:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The application and its repository have been renamed from PulseEffects to `EasyEffects`</li>
          <li>gtkmm3 was replaced by gtkmm4</li>
          <li>Gstreamer was replaced by native PipeWire filters.</li>
          <li>Many features were reimplemented from scratch. The preset autoloading is one example. Another remarkable change will be seen in the plugins selection menu. Now the user can show in the window only the plugins that he/she wants to use.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Boost is no longer a dependency. The price paid for that was a little change in our presets structures. With some patience it is possible to edit PulseEffects presets in a text editor and make them work in EasyEffects. Hopefully someone will come up with a script for this in the feature.</p>
        <p>New libraries are being used and some of the librarires that were optional before are now required</p>
